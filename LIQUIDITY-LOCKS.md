## 🔒 Permanent Liquidity Locks (Dexlab)

The following TEOS-related pools on Dexlab are **permanently locked**, meaning liquidity cannot ever be removed:

1. https://app.dexlab.space/pools/842ViJHy1o3omwLxaVoP4J6EaWPjn2R4uwHh1238FxVB/manage-liquidity  
2. https://app.dexlab.space/pools/AsqrYEAbkkdGSkbb5crxdaaVbp8HUzQWA5YAULENtPKc/manage-liquidity  
3. https://app.dexlab.space/pools/8G3dsNi6mDpHsMtwxi681YKaPKVgSXE8rpTxVYAgymsu/manage-liquidity  

All three pools display **Locked Forever** status.

## 🧠 Why This Helps TEOS

### ✔ 1. Zero Rug Risk  
No one can withdraw liquidity.  
Not the team, not whales, not attackers.  
This completely eliminates the classic crypto rug-pull risk.

### ✔ 2. Protection From Whale Manipulation  
Because liquidity is locked:
- Whales cannot drain pools  
- They cannot remove liquidity to crash price  
- Sudden dumps lose power  

This greatly stabilizes TEOS.

### ✔ 3. Stronger Market Trust  
Permanent locks create trust for:  
- Retail investors  
- Institutions  
- Partners  
- Exchanges  

It shows TEOS is committed to a **long-term economy**.

### ✔ 4. Better Exchange Listing Score  
Centralized exchanges (OKX, Binance, MEXC, Gate) heavily prefer:
- Locked LP  
- Renounced mint authority  
- Fair supply distribution  

This puts TEOS in a **strong position for listing**.
