# TEOS Whale Control Framework  
Designed to protect the TEOS economy from manipulation and maintain long-term stability.

---

## 🦈 Whale Risk Overview
Current distribution shows some wallets holding **15–20%** of supply.

Risks include:
- Dump manipulation  
- Flash dumps before liquidity launch  
- Pool sabotage  
- Governance takeover  
- Sniper accumulation  

---

## 🛡️ Control Layers

### 1️⃣ Civic Badge Verification  
All high-volume wallets must pass:
- Identity badge  
- Civic status check  
- Holder verification  

If a whale becomes harmful:
- Badge revoked  
- Mixer access cut  
- Wallet flagged internally  

---

### 2️⃣ Teos Civic Mixer (Controlled Privacy)
Mixer logs allow TEOS authority to:
- Track whale flows internally  
- Spot accumulation patterns  
- Prevent hidden dumping  
- Block suspicious mixers  

This is privacy **with accountability**.

---

### 3️⃣ Passive Monitoring  
Internal system:
- Tracks supply concentration  
- Whales movement alerts  
- Detects pattern-based threats  
- Observes mixer entry/exit  

---

### 4️⃣ Liquidity Lock Strategy  
No public pool will launch until:
- Holder distribution improves  
- Whale dependence reduces  
- Pioneer pool activation  
- Stabilized market cap  

This protects retail holders.

## 🧬 Final Goal  
A safe, regulated, civic-backed economy:

**Fair for pioneers.  
Fair for citizens.  
Safe from whales.**
