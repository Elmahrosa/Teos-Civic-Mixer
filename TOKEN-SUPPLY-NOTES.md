# TEOS Token Supply Notes  
Part of the TEOS Egypt Blockchain Ecosystem — a unified civil, financial, and smart-city infrastructure powering digital banking, civic governance, DeFi, Pi integration, and national blockchain services.

---

## 🔥 1. Burn Event Summary  
A total of **3,000,000,000 TEOS** has been permanently burned from the total supply.

### Burn Objective
- Reduce circulating supply  
- Increase long-term scarcity  
- Strengthen TEOS market health  
- Protect early holders

Burn event is verifiable on-chain and irreversible.

---

## 🦈 2. Whale Wallet Concentration  
Some wallets currently hold **~20% of the total supply**.

### Why This Matters
- High concentration creates token-dump risk  
- Liquidity pools become unstable  
- Early DEX listing becomes dangerous  
- Price manipulation becomes easier

Because of this concentration, **TEOS cannot launch a public liquidity pool yet**.

---

## 🛑 3. Why No Liquidity Pool Right Now  
A liquidity pool today would allow:
- Whales to dump instantly  
- Price collapse  
- Loss of community trust  
- Early buyers getting wrecked  
- Attackers acquiring governance power cheaply

Until distribution becomes healthier, **TEOS will NOT deploy a pool on AMMs (Raydium, Orca, Meteora, etc.)**.

## 🛡️ 4. Civic-Based Control Layer (Teos Civic Mixer + Badges)  
The TEOS Civic Mixer + Badge Verification System gives us strategic tools:

### ✓ Prevent anonymous whale manipulation  
### ✓ Track whale flow internally without exposing identity  
### ✓ Restrict mixer access for bad actors  
### ✓ Stop hidden dumping behavior  
### ✓ Maintain a fair economic field for citizens  

No other ecosystem connects:
- Token governance  
- Civic identity  
- Privacy  
- Whale control  
into one architecture.

## 🌍 5. Future Liquidity Plan  
A pool will only be created after:

1. Holder distribution becomes healthier  
2. Whales connected to the civic identity system  
3. Governance rules activated  
4. TEOS Pioneers pool is ready  
5. Minimum 10,000 decentralized holders reached  

This ensures:
- Price stability  
- Market fairness  
- Institutional trust  
- Regulatory-safe behavior  

---

## 🏛️ 6. Strategic Vision  
TEOS is not a pump-and-dump token.  
It is a **civil, financial, and national-scale digital asset**.

Liquidity will be activated at the **right time**, not the dangerous time.
